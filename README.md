# Hundred Days Of Code
My professional lifestyle as a developer has changed a lot during last half a year. I have managed to do more project-management and code-reviewing than real development, has spent lots of time playing around with new technologies just to get how do they work and to sell 'em as a part of development stack for another one project.

I've got tired of it.

##Solution?
I have decided to get into that coding stuff with some sort of challenge I have put to myself. Now, I am going to spend half an hour or more each day to get some new techs, work on my own pet projects and just skill-up the GitHub account. Cause why not?

##What will you find here
I am not going to do any documented or really useful things here. All you see here are some sorts of my PoCs, edits, experiments or tutorials implementation - nothing less, and (maybe) nothing more.

##What tech stack?
React, Python, JavaScript, GoLang - anything possible. Actually, I am a full-stack developer specializing on React and Python, but I think there is much more to dive into.

##Anything else?
Wish me luck on this journey. It is gonna be interesting.
